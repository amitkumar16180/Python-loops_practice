# Python For Loop Practice

This repository contains my beginner-level Python programs created while learning **for loops**.
Python is my **first programming language**, and all solutions are written using **basic logic only**.

No advanced or built-in shortcut functions are used unless they were taught in class.

## Topics Covered

The following problems are solved using **for loop concepts**:

1. Accept an integer and print **Hello World** `n` times.
2. Print natural numbers up to `n`.
3. Reverse for loop: print numbers from `n` to `1`.
4. Take a number as input and print its **multiplication table**.
5. Find the **sum of first n terms**.
6. Find the **factorial of a number**.
7. Print the **sum of all even and odd numbers** in a given range separately.
8. Print **all factors of a number**.
9. Accept a number and check whether it is a **perfect number** or not.
   - A perfect number is a number whose sum of factors is equal to the number itself.
   - Example: `6 → 1 + 2 + 3 = 6`
10. Check whether a number is **prime or not**.
11. Reverse a string **without using built-in functions**.
12. Check whether a string is **palindrome or not**.
13. Count **letters, digits, and special symbols** in a given string.
